	<h1>Linux</h1>
	<font size="5">
		<p>Linux is a family of open source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution…
Linux was originated by Linus Torvalds, developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture, but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system.  Linux targets big iron systems such as mainframe computers, large servers, and it is the most used O.S on supercomputers despite it is used by only 2.3 5 of desktop computers…Linux also runs on embedded systems, devices whose operating system is typically built into the firmware and is highly tailored to the system. This includes routers, automation controls, televisions, digital video recorders, video game consoles, and smartwatches. Many smartphones and tablet computers run Android and other Linux derivatives. Because of the dominance of Android on smartphones, Linux has the largest installed base of all general-purpose operating systems.The Unix operating system was conceived in 1969. First released in 1971, Unix was written entirely in assembly language, as was common practice at the time. In 1973 in a key, pioneering approach, it was rewritten in the C programming language. The availability of a high-level language implementation of Unix made its porting to different computer platforms easier...Due to an earlier antitrust case forbidding it from entering the computer business, AT&T was required to license the operating system's source code to anyone who asked. As a result, Unix grew quickly and became widely adopted by academic institutions and businesses. In 1984, AT&T divested itself of Bell Labs; freed of the legal obligation requiring free licensing, Bell Labs began selling Unix as a proprietary product, where users were not legally allowed to modify Unix. The GNU Project, started in 1983, had the goal of creating a complete Unix-compatible software system composed entirely of free software. Work began in 1984..</p>
		<h2>What Is Linux</h2>
		<p>When Linux was released about 29 years ago, an open source software knocked down all the walls that was put in place by priority software giants like Microsoft in order to maintain control over the development and distribution of computer programs.
Using windows with its high degree of compatibility was fine for everyday usage for many people especially gamers, but since windows is a priority O.S. developers and users have to work with certain restrictions on what you can do.
Linux has a completely open source kernel; meaning it can be used freely in order of whatever you want.
Linux versions are commonly called distribution or distros, which provided different groups of softwares, tools, desktop environment; all are tied to Linux kernel.
Linux focused on security and stability, while windows focused on the ease of use, so it became extremely popular for servers and supercomputers, as it is much less weight and richer in recourses than windows which is more useful for home users and non-tech who only wants fast computer experience, but when you want a game, that can be a challenge for a number of titles requiring you to run a windows compatibility layers such as wine.</p>
		<h2>Distros</h2>
		<h3>Ubuntu</h3>
		<img src="ubuntu.png" alt="ubuntu">
		<p>Most popular Linux distros, offers desktops, servers and cloud versions of its operating system for personal and professional uses… larger community means more programs, support for the distro and that exist in ubuntu… new version of ubuntu is released every 6 months with long term support releases every 2 years and that may cause a problem as you cant get the latest updates to your software, on the other hand ubuntu includes wide variety of software package, simple design, smooth operation and easy installations</p>
		<h3>Linux Mint</h3>
		<img src="linux mint.jfif" alt="linux mint">
		<p>The most user friendly Linux distros, as it looks and behaves similar to windows making transitions and learning curve thrive.. it is passed of ubuntu, so you get the same package as ubuntu.. but it also has the same issue as ubuntu which is the long term support releases and late updates, so some developers make a personal archives (PPA), which is a private software repositories that you can subscribe to on Linux Mint or Ubuntu in order to keep getting the latest versions of software.. Ubuntu may be the most Linux distros able to be modified by user starting from the user interface till its programing… </p>
		<h3>Fedora</h3>
		<img src="fedora.png" alt="fedora">
		<p>Among all the Linux distros, Fedora adheres most to the free software philosophy, using only free and open source software in their official software repositories, showing the advantages that can come from a purely free environment but also inhibit functionality in times when priority drivers are needed as graphics cards </p>
		<h3>openSUSE</h3>
	<img src="opensuse.png" alt="opensuse">
		<p>OpenSUSE is a rolling release distribution meaning that instead of new version of the distro releasing within a fixed monthly cycle, they are updated continuously, and so updated versions of Linux kernel, desktops, software package are updated shortly after their publish releasing from the developers.. in openSUSE the rolling release code named tumbleweed.. it take advantage of the open source desktop software and modifies it to fit their theme, style and operations, with other benefits as enterprise grade stability.</p>
		<h3>arch linux</h3>
		<img src="archlinux.jfif" alt="arch linux">
		<p>Arch Linux is a rolling release and that eradicates the system update craze that users of other distro types go through. Because it’s a rolling release, its core system is always up to date with the latest fixes and new features and you wouldn’t have to worry about when to install what and how long system updates will take. Also, every update is compatible with your system so there is no fear about which updates might break something and this makes Arch Linux one of the most stable and reliable distros ever.
Come with the Arch User Repository (AUR) is a collection of applications and tools that are installable on Arch Linux but not yet available in the official Arch repository.
It is maintained by the Arch Linux user community as a means to conveniently find and install those apps without hunting them down and compiling them from source.</p>
