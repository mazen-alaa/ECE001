	<h1>macOS</h1>
	<font size="5">
	<p>macOS is the second major series of Macintosh operating systems. The first is colloquially called the classic Mac OS, introduced in 1984, the final release of which was Mac OS 9 in 1999. The first desktop version, Mac OS X 10.0, was released in March 2001, with its first update, 10.1, arriving later that year. After this, Apple began naming its releases after big cats, which lasted until OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion. Since OS X 10.9 Mavericks, releases have been named after locations in California.Apple shortened the name to "OS X" in 2012 and then changed it to "macOS" in 2016, adopting the nomenclature that they were using for their other operating systems, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS. The latest version is macOS Catalina, which was publicly released in October 2019….Between 1999 and 2009, Apple sold a separate series of operating systems called Mac OS X Server. The initial version, Mac OS X Server 1.0, was released in 1999 with a user interface similar to Mac OS 8.5. After this, new versions were introduced concurrently with the desktop version of Mac OS X. Beginning with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, the server functions were made available as a separate package on the Mac App Store… macOS is based on the Unix operating system and on technologies developed between 1985 and 1997 at NeXT, a company that Apple co-founder Steve Jobs created after leaving Apple in 1985. The "X" in Mac OS X and OS X is the Roman numeral for the number 10 and is pronounced as such. The X was a prominent part of the operating system's brand identity and marketing in its early years, but gradually receded in prominence since the release of Snow Leopard in 2009. UNIX 03 certification was achieved for the Intel version of Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard and all releases from Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard up to the current version also have UNIX 03 certification. macOS shares its Unix-based core, named Darwin, and many of its frameworks with iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, and watchOS. A heavily modified version of Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger was used for the first-generation Apple TV… Releases of Mac OS X from 1999 to 2005 ran on the PowerPC-based Macs of that period. After Apple announced that they were switching to Intel CPUs from 2006 onwards, versions were released for 32-bit and 64-bit Intel-based Macs. Versions from Mac OS X 10.7 Lion (2011) run exclusively on 64-bit Intel CPUs, in contrast to the ARM architecture used on iOS, watchOS, and tvOS devices, and do not support PowerPC applications macos was written in c++,c,swift,objective-c.</p>
	<h2>History</h2>
	<p>First version was released in 1984, when apple introduce Macintosh, it was the first commercial computer to feature a G.U.I. in your mouse, made it a lot easier to use especially for the non-tech users, previously using a computer meant to understand the designated texture commands needed to interact with the command line interface as in apple 2 or IBMC, although Macintosh didn’t make it in sellings as it was hoped, it proved that there is a better way to interact with the user interface… but there commercial tragedy drove apple to a slippery slop and they were about to announce their bankrupt…meanwhile bill gates was making Microsoft a lot of money by licensing their O.S. to other computer manufactures willing to pay for it, but of course that wasn’t the main goal, the main goal was to capture more market shares to beat their rivals.. by 1996, Macintosh was running on an operating system hadn’t been updated for 5 years which was OS 7 and Microsoft was about to overtake apple but for their decision to begin licensing their Macintosh O.S. to third party manufactures in order to be able to purchase a new O.S. to be used in the next generation of Macintosh, and then they found next company for softwares which was originated by Steve jobs after he left apple and cooperated with next softwares in 1997..5 months later mac OS 8 was ready to be released.. yet 5 months is a very short time to announce a new operating system, that returns to the very small edits which were done on the OS 7. but the most important decision was that Steve jobs stopped licensing the macOS to third party manufacture. since then apple started to thrive. the came with the glorious Mac OS 9 which is the ninth and last major release of Apple's classic Mac OS operating system. Introduced on October 23, 1999, it was promoted by Apple as "The Best Internet Operating System Ever", highlighting Sherlock 2's Internet search capabilities, integration with Apple's free online services known as iTools and improved Open Transport networking.
